## Recommendations

If I were to advise Betterment, I would suggest that they continue to focus on financial planning and goal-based investing. This is their core competency and what sets them apart from their competitors. I would also suggest that they continue to invest in cutting-edge technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, to improve their investment management and customer experience. In addition, I would suggest that Betterment consider expanding their services to include other financial products, such as insurance or mortgages. This would allow them to offer a more comprehensive suite of financial products to their customers and potentially increase their customer base. 

Another thing they could do is enhance its mobile app by incorporating gamification features that encourage users to set and achieve financial goals. Additionally, integrating features like personalized financial insights, educational content, and an improved user interface would drive user engagement and satisfaction. This might not sound like a great a idea at first, but this will incenstivate more users to learn about finance.

Overall, Betterment has been able to successfully disrupt the traditional investment industry by providing a low-cost, high-quality investment advice and portfolio management to the masses. Its focus on financial planning and goal-based investing has set it apart from its competitors, and its user-friendly platform has made it accessible to everyday investors. Betterment has a bright future ahead, and I am excited to see how it continues to evolve and grow in the years to come.
